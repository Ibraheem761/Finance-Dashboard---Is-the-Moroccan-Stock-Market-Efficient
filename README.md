The **MASI** index (Moroccan All Shares Index) is a stock index that tracks the performance of all companies listed in the Casablanca Stock Exchange located at Casablanca, Morocco. <br> <br>
In this project I created a model that predicts the MASI index with high accuracy, thus proving the Moroccan Stock Market to be **inefficient**,i.e, Prices do no reflect all information.
